#Workstation setup
##Setup my laptop the way I like it.
This playbook has been tested with Xubuntu 16.04.3
While it may very well run on other Ubuntu-like distros, the results might be b'jankety because some of the configurations are specific to xfce4

Run it with `ansible-playbook -K ./workstation-setup.yml`   
It's going to ask for your `sudo` password. You should enter it.
